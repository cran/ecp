* The DJIA dataset now incudes the univariate  market index, as well as the multivariate time series created by the DOW30 companies. Kraft is not included in the multivariate series.

* The list elements in the DJIA dataset are now named; "date", "index", and "market". The "index" component used to be named "returns". The "market" component contains the multivariate time series.

ecp 1.5.4
============
Changes made since previous version

* Some of the components of the list returned by both methods have been renamed.

* The member argument for e.agglo now has a default value.

* Fixed issue with the e.agglo penalty argument.

* The penalty argument for e.agglo now accepts a function that depends only on the change point locations.

* Both the e.agglo and e.divisive methods now also return the estimated membership vector.

* The e.divisive method now also returns a vector containing the number of permutations performed at each stage of the sequential testing procedure.

* The STPP dataset has been removed from the package.

ecp 1.5.3
============
Changes made since previous version

* The agglomerative procedure now includes an argument for a penalty term.

* New permutation test implementation. The new version is based on the method of Gandy (2009), and R 
now is the maximum number of permutations to perform.

* Added 2 additional arguments to the e.divisive() method. These arguments are necessary to implement the 
updated permutation test.

* Function argument names now adhere to standard R naming conventions.

* Names of returned list components now adhere to standard R naming convention.

* In the list returned by the e.divisive() method, the list component has been renamed estimates.

* Updated documentation.

ecp 1.5.2
============
Changes made since previous version

* Reordered the argument list for the e.agglo() method. The call is now e.agglo(data, member, alpha=1).
