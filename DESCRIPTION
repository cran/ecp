Description: Implements various procedures for finding 
	     multiple change-points from Matteson D. et al (2013)
	     <doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.849605>, Zhang W. et al (2017) 
	     <doi:10.1109/ICDMW.2017.44>, Arlot S. et al (2019).
	     Two methods make use of dynamic  
	     programming and pruning, with no distributional 
	     assumptions other than the existence of certain absolute 
	     moments in one method. Hierarchical and exact search methods 
	     are included. All methods return the set of estimated change-
	     points as well as other summary information.
